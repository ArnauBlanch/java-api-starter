# Java API Starter
This repo contains a template to develop a Spring Boot API using Java 17.

It contains some sample code and a set of utilities included:
- [**Project Lombok**](https://projectlombok.org/) for writing less-repetitive Java code
- [**Retrofit**](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) as HTTP client
- **OpenAPI docs** generation and UI (Swagger)
- [**JUnit 5**](https://junit.org/junit5/) as testing framework
- [**Mockito**](https://site.mockito.org/) as mocking framework for tests
- [**AssertJ**](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) for fluent test assertions
- [**REST Assured**](https://rest-assured.io/) to test and validate REST controllers
- [**WireMock**](https://wiremock.org/) and [**MockWebServer**](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) for mocking APIs
- [**Testcontainers**](https://www.testcontainers.org/) for running tests that need external services like DB using Docker
